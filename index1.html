			  <h1>Strangers To Ourselves</h1>
			  <p>In this piece of writing, the writer Julia Kristeva demonstrated the definition of a foreigner and clearly pointed out almost all the incidences that a foreigner might experience. Before reading this piece, whenever I heard the word ‘Foreigner’ the first thing that used to come to my mind was a person who travelled to a new country from his native country. While reading this literature, the idea of everybody being a foreigner was like an eye opener for me. Kristeva gave a definition of foreigner: “the foreigner lives within us: he is the hidden face of our identity, the space that wrecks our abode, the time in which understanding and affinity founder”. By stating this, the writer pointed out our hidden foreigners in ourselves that we experience throughout our lives at some point.</p>

			  <h1>The Pickup</h1>
			  <p>In Nadine Gordimer’s The Pickup, the writer portrayed a complicated love affair between an illegal Muslim immigrant, Abdu, who worked in an auto shop and a woman, Julie, who was from an upper class white family.  The story took place in South Africa where Julie “picked up” Abdu, because her car broke down. Instantly Julie was mesmerized by Abdu’s physical appearance and way of doing things. The root of the complication in this love story was more geared towards social status, personal wants, needs and one another’s identity.</p>

			  <h1>Lou, The Prophet</h1>
			  <p>Lou was a 22-year-old young man who was a very simple person. People considered him less promising than his brothers. Lou’s family left from Denmark when he was a boy. He was living west for 7 years but always missed his home, Denmark. The people who came from the north to the west don’t miss their homelands as much as southern people. They thought if they grew crops in the new place the land will be theirs forever. Lou had some characteristics that set him apart from others. He lived his life from what sounded like a very humble way. Lou also had some tragedies happened to him throughout his life and it seemed as if he did not let those things bother him much.</p>
